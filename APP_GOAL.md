# Van Electrical Design App: Comprehensive Goal Description

## Purpose
The app exists to help people planning or building a van conversion design a safe, functional, and maintainable electrical system. It enables users to translate real-world power needs into a complete electrical schema and a clear, validated plan for sourcing compatible components. The app is educational, practical, and decision‑supportive: it helps users understand tradeoffs, avoid common mistakes, and assemble a system that works as intended.

## Who It Serves
The app is intended for:
- Individuals building or renovating vans for travel, work, or living.
- Makers and hobbyists with limited electrical engineering background.
- Experienced builders who want a faster, more reliable way to document and validate designs.
- Professionals who want to present a clear electrical plan to clients.

It is designed to be accessible to novices while still robust enough for advanced users.

## Core Outcomes
The app should enable users to:
- Define their power needs (loads, usage patterns, peak demand).
- Specify available energy sources (solar, alternator, shore power, generators).
- Choose a storage strategy (battery type, capacity, and configuration).
- Design a complete electrical schema with correct wiring paths and protection.
- Validate compatibility and safety of selected components.
- Generate a coherent parts list with appropriate specifications.
- Understand why each component is chosen and how it fits the system.

## Guiding Principles
The app should:
- Be technology‑agnostic and not prescribe a specific product brand or vendor.
- Prioritize safety, clarity, and explainability.
- Encourage informed decisions by surfacing constraints and tradeoffs.
- Be transparent about assumptions and calculations.
- Support iterative design and “what‑if” exploration.

## Functional Scope (Technology‑Agnostic)
The app is expected to provide a structured flow that guides a user from needs analysis to a validated design. Key capabilities include:

### 1) Needs & Usage Modeling
- Capture all electrical loads (appliances, devices, tools).
- Allow users to describe usage patterns (hours per day, duty cycles).
- Distinguish between continuous loads and surge/peak loads.
- Summarize daily energy consumption and peak power demand.

### 2) Energy Source Modeling
- Let users define how energy is generated or replenished.
- Represent different sources (e.g., solar, alternator, shore power).
- Allow configurable availability (seasonal or usage constraints).
- Calculate expected energy input across typical usage scenarios.

### 3) Storage Strategy Design
- Support different battery chemistries and configurations.
- Help users size storage to meet autonomy goals (days off‑grid).
- Consider depth of discharge, longevity targets, and temperature limits.
- Surface implications of capacity and configuration choices.

### 4) System Architecture & Schema Building
- Provide a way to construct a system layout with clear connections.
- Support typical electrical domains (DC low‑voltage, AC if used).
- Include key elements: chargers, converters, inverters, distribution, protection.
- Ensure wiring paths and protection elements are complete and coherent.

### 5) Safety, Compatibility & Constraints
- Validate component compatibility (voltage levels, current capacity).
- Check wire sizing, fusing, and protection placement logic.
- Highlight thermal, voltage drop, and safety risks.
- Provide warnings and explain the reasons behind them.

### 6) Bill of Materials & Documentation
- Generate a structured parts list with specs and quantities.
- Output a clear, shareable electrical diagram or description.
- Provide a summary of assumptions and calculated values.
- Support export for planning, purchasing, or professional review.

## User Experience Goals
The app should feel:
- Clear and guided, but not restrictive.
- Trustworthy through transparent reasoning and explicit checks.
- Adaptable to different skill levels and design approaches.
- Focused on helping users reach a safe, working system.

## Non‑Goals
The app is not intended to:
- Replace certified electrical advice where required by law or safety standards.
- Lock users into specific brands, vendors, or technologies.
- Function as a sales platform disguised as a planner.
- Encourage unsafe shortcuts or unsupported configurations.

## Definition of Success
The app succeeds when users can confidently:
- Build an electrical plan that meets their real needs.
- Understand the logic of their system and its limitations.
- Obtain the right components with the correct specifications.
- Reduce risk of under‑sizing, over‑spending, or unsafe wiring.
